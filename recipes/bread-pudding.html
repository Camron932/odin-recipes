        <h2>Description</h2>
        Bread pudding is a dessert made with slightly stale bread and custard. The no-waste dish is so old, nobody knows quite when or where it originated. People in 13th-century England called it "poor man's pudding" because the cooks who made it couldn't afford to throw any ingredients away.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 slices day-old bread, torn into small pieces
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
            </li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Place bread pieces into an 8-inch square baking pan. Drizzle melted butter over bread and sprinkle raisins over top.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk milk, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla together in a medium mixing bowl until well combined. Pour mixture over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until all bread is covered and soaking up the liquid.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
